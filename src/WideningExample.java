// The following conversions combine both widening and narrowing primitive conversions:
// First, the byte is converted to an int via widening primitive conversion (ยง5.1.2), and then the resulting int is converted to a char by narrowing primitive conversion (ยง5.1.3).
// So... This does not work for variables, compiler does not have enough information to determine if the narrowing is ok.
